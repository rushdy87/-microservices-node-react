What is a monolith server?
  - A monolith server is a server that utilizes a monolithic architecture, as a monolithic server 
    is self-contained and does not require any dependence on any other servers.
What are microservices?
  - s an architectural method that relies on a series of independently deployable services. These 
    services have their own business logic and database with a specific goal. Updating, testing, 
    deployment, and scaling occur within each service.
  - Each service gets its own database (if it needs one).
  - Services will never, ever reach into another services database.

Database per service:
  - every service has it's own database.

Quize:
Question 1:
Creating one database per service seems like a waste!  Why do we create one database per service?
1- WE want every service to be able to act independently without depending on any other service.
2- If each service has its own database, we can optimize what type of database we pick for a service.
3- a single database shared between many services would be a single point of failure, which would limted 
  the reliablty of our app.
4- All of the above.
Question 2:
Imagine you are developing a service called ProductsService. Your service's goal is to manage all aspects 
of products sold on your platform.
Another engineer who is responsible for a different service comes to you and asks for documentation on how 
to connect to your services database. 
How would you respond?
1- I would show them how to connect directly to my database from there service.
2- I would asked them to find another way to get information out of may service's database.
Question 3:
What is the #1 challenge in microservices?
1- Manging data between different services.
2- implementing monntering and logging for services writen in different languages.
3- Deploy two services in the same time.

Communication Strategies Between Services:
  - Sync: Services communicate with each other using direct requests.
  - Async: Services communicate with each other using events.

CORS:
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism or a protocol that allows devices on one domain to 
access resources residing on other domains.
Generally, for security reasons, browsers forbid requests that come in from cross-domain sources. However, 
there could be cases where you want to overcome this and access cross-domain resources, and CORS makes this 
possible.
